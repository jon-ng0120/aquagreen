From 25-45 cm tall and the creeping rhizome from 10-15 cm or more. Anubias barteri varies considerably in terms of size and leaf shape.

    Like other Anubias-species, it is best planted in a shady spot to minimize algae growth on the leaves. If planted on the bottom, the rhizome must not be covered because it tends to rot. It is also suitable for terrariums and paludariums. Herbivorous fish do not eat the very tough and robust leaves.`,

    description: `Sagittaria subulata from South America is an ideal, undemanding foreground plant whose short runners form a compact group.

    Place individual plants 2-4 cm apart. This plant may cause problems because in certain conditions it suddenly grows to a height of 50 cm when it grows older. But if it is then moved into the background it may become low again. In the aquarium, it sometimes sends a long flower stem to the surface, and small white flowers unfold just above the water surface.`,

Its nearest relative in the aquaristic is Hygrophila but Staurogyne is different with its marked compact, low and bushy stature (5-10 cm) and small green leaves (each stem is 3.4 cm wide).
    When planting in the aquarium, the longest upright shoots should be cut off and new, horizontally creeping shoots will soon form from the plant basis and gradually colonize the gravel.
    At low light, the growth will be more upright and much less side shoots will be formed.`,
